"biography": "Greg Egan (born 20 August 1961)[2] is an Australian science fiction writer and amateur mathematician, best known for his works of hard science fiction. Egan has won multiple awards including the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, the Hugo Award, and the Locus Award.Egan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the University of Western Australia. He published his first work in 1983.[6] He specialises in hard science fiction stories with mathematical and quantum ontology themes, including the nature of consciousness.He is a Hugo Award winner (with eight other works shortlisted for the Hugos) and has also won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.[7] His early stories feature strong elements of supernatural horror.\n\nEgan's short stories have been published in a variety of genre magazines, including regular appearances in Interzone and Asimov's Science Fiction.n 2018, Egan described a construction of superpermutations, thus giving an upper bound to their length. On 27 February 2019, using ideas developed by Robin Houston and others, Egan produced a superpermutation of n = 7 symbols of length 5906, breaking previous records.[8][9]Egan does not attend science fiction conventions,[12] does not sign books, and has stated that he appears in no photographs on the web,[1] though both SF fan sites and Google Search have at times mistakenly represented photos of other people with the same name as those of the writer.[13]Permutation City: John W.
